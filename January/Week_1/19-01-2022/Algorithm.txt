Step 1: take the array as act_arr from which we have to find the missing element.
Step 2: take a variable act_sum to store the sum of act_arr elements.
Step 3: for (int i=0; i<=act_arr.length; i++)
Step 4: act_sum = act_sum + act_arr[i]
Step 5: now act_sum will contain the sum of act_arr.
Step 6: take an expected array as exp_arr.
Step 7: take a variable exp_sum to store the sum of exp_arr elements.
Step 8: for calculating the sum of exp_arr:
        exp_sum = (exp_arr.length)*(exp_arr.length + 1)/2
Step 9: take a variable miss_num to store missing number from the act_arr.
Step 10: now by substracting the act_sum from the exp_sum we will get the missing number:
        miss_num = exp_sum - act_sum
Step 11: print the miss_num.
